# generate-measurementset-casapy

A casapy script to generate a simulated measurementset, and optionally image it
using the Cotton-Schwab clean algorithm.

To do:
  - Modify script to read in a list of source positions from the local-sky-model,
    and generate visibilities for multiple sources accordingly.
